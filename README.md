# Hi there, I'm Satinath Mondal

**Staff Software Engineer** | Chicago, IL

I'm a passionate software engineer dedicated to crafting architecture designs and delivering high-quality, scalable, and clean code. I enjoy exploring new technology areas and staying at the forefront of software development practices.

## About Me

With extensive experience in enterprise software development, I specialize in building robust backend systems and exploring cutting-edge technologies. My work spans from traditional enterprise Java applications to modern AI-powered solutions.
