## Current Interests

Currently focused on building AI-native applications using RAG architectures, AI agents powered by MCP servers, and practical AI tooling for developers. I'm exploring ways to integrate LLMs into enterprise workflows while maintaining governance and compliance through tools like prompt validation and policy-as-code approaches.

## Featured Projects

- **[promptlint](https://github.com/satinath-nit/promptlint)** - A lightweight, policy-as-code tool for validating LLM prompts against enterprise compliance rules
- **[ai-dev-playbook](https://github.com/satinath-nit/ai-dev-playbook)** - A curated collection of tested prompt patterns and workflows for real coding tasks that work in ANY AI coding assistant
- **[ai-usage-measurement-framework](https://github.com/satinath-nit/ai-usage-measurement-framework)** - Measure and analyze AI-assisted development in git repositories
- **[sample-mcp-server](https://github.com/satinath-nit/sample-mcp-server)** - MCP Server implementation example in Python
- **[llm-rag-cookbook](https://github.com/satinath-nit/llm-rag-cookbook)** - RAG implementation patterns and recipes
